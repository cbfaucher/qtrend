BUGS
====
Pourquoi en udate on peut pas updater le jour meme "Ticker already up to date".
Use date for "Show Graphics", and add option for the epoch
TODOs (priority,alert).
Use Tables to display stuff.
Get news on Yahoo for a ticker (latest or on specific days)
Get better error for database not started.
Actually, it should start by itself...   
In OBB, range for OHLC is not well measure (needs prob. cents in scale, not $)
Add a support to change range view in Show Graphics.
Send t Google Graphics

TODO 2018
=========
- Update Spring
- Use SpringBoot instead of Bootstrap
- DELETE TODAY, REUPDATE
- Find and remove duplicate dates, recalculate
    SELECT TICKER, "date", COUNT(*) AS NB
    FROM STOCKQUOTES
    GROUP BY TICKER, "date"
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    ORDER BY TICKER, "date"
    ;
- Use @RequiredArgsConstructor
    com.quartz.qtrend.actions.yahoo.UpdateTickersAction
    com.quartz.qtrend.dom.yahoo.YahooService
- Replace QUtilities Logging by Log4J/Slf4j
- Replace JobRunner by Executors
