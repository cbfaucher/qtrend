
INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================


- Unzip the content to a directory somewhere.
- Make sure your PostgreSQL server (service) is running on port 5432 (default post)

NOTE: The Steps 1 to 4 only need to be done ONCE (first install)

1) Set JAVA_HOME
----------------
- In QTrend/bin, rename (or copy)
        set_javahome.bat.template
    to
        set_javahome.bat
- Set the JAVA_HOME to where your Java 1.5 is installed.

2) Set PostgreSQL config
------------------------
- In QTrend/bin, rename (or copy)
        set_postgresconfig.bat.template
    to
        set_postgresconfig.bat
- Edit the file, and set the variables as appropriate

3) Setup database (first install)
---------------------------------

- Make sure the PostgreSQL's postgres user is defined.
- FIRST, you MAY take a backup of your current QTrend DB, using bin/backup.bat, which
    will create a sql/my-backup-qtrend.sql file.
- Execute initdb-qtrend.bat
    You will have a bunch of "ERROR" messages at the beginning of execution, complaining
    that "Function 'abc' already exists with same arguments."
    IGNORE THOSE MESSAGES!

    The important is the what comes next to that, that must NOT have any errors.

    AND VOILA!!!

4) Setup exchanges
------------------

- In QTrend/config, rename (or copy)
        exchange-configuration-template.xml
    to
        exchange-configuration.xml
- Edit the files to reflect the exchanges you want to use

In the future, you may need to update this file again, as you use
new exchanges.
